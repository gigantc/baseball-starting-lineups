The service is running on the gigantc.com server.

We're using 'systemctl start baseball-watcher' to keep it going full time and posting directly to the "MLB CAPTAIN LEAGUE" discord server.

To start the service manually(but this should auto-start with the server):
sudo systemctl start baseball-watcher

To stop the service:
sudo systemctl stop baseball-watcher

To restart the service:
sudo systemctl restart baseball-watcher

To check the service status:
sudo systemctl status baseball-watcher

To view live logs:
journalctl -u baseball-watcher -f

Disable it from starting on boot:
sudo systemctl disable baseball-watcher
and then
sudo systemctl stop baseball-watcher
